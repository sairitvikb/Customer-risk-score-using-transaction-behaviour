## Customer Risk Scoring Using Transaction Behavior 
## *An explainable, Excel-to-Python risk scoring model for compliance prioritization*


## Executive Summary

This project explore how simple transaction behavior indicators can be combined into a clear and explainable risk scoring framework to support customer prioritization for compliance reviews. Using Excel and Python, I developed a weighted risk score based on transaction frequency, average transaction value, and jurisdiction exposure. The results show how a risk-based approach can help focus compliance resources on higher-risk customers while reducing unnecessary reviews.

## 1. Business Context

Financial institutions must balance regulatory obligations with operational efficiency. Traditional rule-based monitoring often generates excessive alerts, many of which represent low-risk customers. This creates review backlogs and strains compliance teams.

A risk-based prioritization model helps ensure that investigative effort is focused where it matters most.

## 2. Business Question

Which customers should be prioritized for compliance review based on observable transaction behavior and jurisdiction exposure?

## 3. Data Description

This analysis uses a simulated customer-level dataset designed to reflect realistic AML monitoring scenarios while avoiding confidentiality and privacy concerns. The dataset was intentionally kept small to ensure transparency and interpretability of the scoring logic.

## Key Variables

- **customer_id** – Unique customer identifier

- **txn_count** – Number of transactions over a 30-day period

- **avg_txn_amount** – Average transaction value

- **high_risk_country** – Indicator of exposure to higher-risk jurisdictions (1 = Yes, 0 = No)

- **flagged** – Simulated indicator of whether the customer was reviewed

- **txn_norm** – Normalized transaction frequency

- **amt_norm** – Normalized transaction value

- **risk_score** – Weighted risk score

Simulated data allows the focus to remain on analytical logic, explainability, and decision-making rather than proprietary information.

## 4. Methodology

The analysis followed a structured, rule-based approach:

- Created a simulated dataset representing customer transaction behavior

- Normalized transaction frequency and transaction value to a 0–1 scale

- Designed a weighted risk score to combine behavioral and jurisdiction indicators

- Ranked customers based on overall risk score

- Interpreted results to support compliance prioritization decisions

**Risk Score Formula**

**Risk Score** = (0.4 × Transaction Frequency) 
          **+ (0.4 × Transaction Amount)**
          **+ (0.2 × High-Risk Jurisdiction Indicator)**


The weights were selected to emphasize behavioral risk, while still accounting for jurisdiction exposure.

## 5. Key Findings

- Customers with higher transaction frequency and larger average transaction values consistently received higher risk scores.

- Exposure to high-risk jurisdictions increased risk, but behavioral indicators had a stronger influence on overall prioritization.

- Several customers with jurisdiction exposure alone remained low-risk due to minimal transaction activity, supporting a balanced, risk-based approach.

## 6. Business Interpretation

The results demonstrate that not all customers linked to higher-risk jurisdictions require immediate review. Instead, combining behavioral indicators with jurisdiction exposure enables compliance teams to better differentiate between high-priority and low-priority cases, improving efficiency without compromising regulatory expectations.

## 7. Recommendations

- Apply a transparent, weighted risk scoring approach to prioritize customer reviews.

- Focus investigative resources on customers with elevated behavioral risk rather than jurisdiction alone.

- Regularly review and adjust weights as transaction patterns or regulatory guidance evolve.

## 8. Limitations & Next Steps

## Limitations

Data is simulated and simplified for demonstration purposes.

The model does not include transaction sequencing or network relationships.

## Next Steps

Introduce risk buckets (Low / Medium / High) to support operational workflows.

Replicate the logic in Python or SQL for scalability.

Compare rule-based scoring with basic statistical or machine learning models.
